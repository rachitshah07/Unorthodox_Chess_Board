# Unorthodox_Chess_Board 
Created a GUI using Python Tkinter module for an unorthodox chess game. \
Here, the main task was to safeguard the white king at a safe cell where none of the black pieces(more than one occurance of a single type of piece is also possible) can kill it. \
Algorithm structured successfully safeguards the white king from any black piece.\
This chessboard is created under the name or algorithm of **Smart Navigator**.
